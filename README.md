# React Tests

Initially tested conditional rendering but now used for general react testing.

Use this code base to test.

# Conditional Rendering &amp; HOC

The source tree is setup in a component directory structures
that corresponds to the table of contents (TOC). Below the
TOC label is shown and then the component directory.

  - if statement - if
  - ternary operation - ternary
  - logical && operator - logic
  - switch case operator - case
  - enums - enums
  - Multi-Level Conditional Rendering - _skip_
  - With Higher Order Components - hoc
  - External Templating Components -_skip_

Skipped multi-level because it is a just a bracketed extension of logical.
Skipped templating because react does templating without so don't need
another external templating system.
